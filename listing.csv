Truck has around 132k miles and is a 6 speed manual. Off road package with Bilstein shocks, diff lock, and a-trac system. Over the last year or so it’s had new spark plugs, serpentine belt, all pulley bearings replaced, alternator, tires, muffler, cv axle (ripped boot), upper ball joints, front brakes/calipers/rotors, and oil changed. Also comes with 4 steel rims and a Meyer poly plow. Plow is 78” and only used for my father’s driveway (a tad longer than a football field). Plow was put on after I got the truck and stored indoors, and used maybe 6 times over the years . Truck was my daily driver but growing family has lead to a new vehicle. 
Any body issues are pictured and are an easy fix. Tailgate is a bit dented and the rear bumper is getting rust. A/C could use a recharge also.Please know how to drive a manual or bring someone who does. My time is valuable so please don’t waste it. Any questions, please ask.

FORD F250 2001 DIESEL 7.3 
Best motor on the Fords diesel, 7.3, has 192000 miles on it, I bought a new F250 so I don't need this one anymore.
Is a beast, a work truck with dents and scratches so please don't bother with pointing out what I can see too.
Is a 8' long bed, bed has some rust under, but still hold loads of materials.
Plow is included in the price, I just plow for the past 3 years 8 residential accounts, Ladder rack, big mud tires and tool boxes ARE NOT INCLUDED I can sale them for an additional price.
This truck has so much life left.
AC does not work, heat works well.
Some repairs done recently like, new exhaust manifold,  new batteries, new new rear brakes, new new wipers, new starter, new muffler, new tail pipe, new diesel pression sensor, just have oil changed.
Engine and transmission in perfect condition.
Has auxiliary lights and soft close spring for tailgate (DEZZEE)
AGAIN IS A WORK TRUCK, 2001 NOT A 2021 SHOW ROOM TRUCK. THANKS.
 It comes with original factory tires, I also have an extra set of tires for an additional price.
